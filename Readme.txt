This is the small implementation which is been tried to be done of API Endpoints through which we can easily create and update the profile of the user.
We use javascript, (PUT,POST,GET) commands for the API request and also for JWT authentications.
Express js and node js is also included in it and also the postman and database is run on the mongoDB database.
Also add node modules because i havent added it in this!
